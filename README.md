# Small Area Estimation for Disease Prevalence Mapping
Small area estimation (SAE) entails estimating characteristics of interest for domains, often geographical areas, in which there may be few or no samples available. 
Kenya accounted for approximately 3% of global malaria cases in 2019, with children under five years of age being the most vulnerable group. 
The aim of this project is to provide an overview of prevalence of malaria among children aged 6-59 months in Kenya using small area estimation (SAE) techniques in comparing direct estimators and indirect estimators. 

The following models are compared :
1. Naïve Estimation
2. Direct Estimation - Horvitz and Thompson Estimator
3. Indirect Estimation - Fay – Herriot Area Level Model

Data used:
* Kenya MIS 2020 (DHS)
* Geospatial data (GADM)

Skills used:
* R & R Markdown
* Small Area Estimation
